# Fraud-Detection-Project

Welcome to the "Fraud Detection Project".

I applied Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Network algorithms and SMOTE technique. I also visualized the performances of the models using Seaborn, Matplotlib and Yellowbrick in various ways.

At the end of the project, I had the opportunity to put my model into operation with the Streamlit API.
